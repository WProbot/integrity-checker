<h2>Privacy and terms</h2>

<h3>What is this?</h3>

<p>
    The Integrity Checker plugin is a free WordPress plugin, it uses a backend API located at our servers to provide information about plugins and themes. The plugin and the backend service is owned and developed by Torgesta Technology AB, a Swedish company. The plugin itself is licenced under the GPL v2 software license. The backend service needed for the plugin to work is not open source and using the backend service comes with some restrictions.
</p><p>
    We have spent a great deal of time to develop the API itself as well as collecting all the data it serves. We're aiming to find a balance between providing a commercial service to large and small companies that benefits from the data we provide and at the same time providing a useful and free service for personal projects, non-profit organizations and the occasional "help I've been hacked" situation. While trying to find that balance, we are going to do test various ways to get as many happy users as possible while earning enough money to keep the service up and running. In the unfortunate situation that we can't find that balance, we'll almost certainly prioritize keeping the service up and running.
</p>


<h3>Anonymous users</h3>
<p>
    As an antonymous user, your access to the backend API is restricted to 25 requests per hour. We figure this is enough to make a scan of all themes and plugins on a small to medium WordPress site and to examine any issues found a little bit further.
</p><p>
    The first time you use Integrity Checker, an API key will be automatically created and stored in your WordPress installation. We don't collect any personal information about you at this stage, but we do register the IP address that your requests comes from as well as any other information that's normally passed on in a http request header. No personal data, but data that could identify your WordPress installation. This is to give us some way of determining if an anonymous user is trying to bypass the rate limitation we've set. For anonymous usage, we reserve the right to block an API key, an IP number or even an entire API range at any time. We'd only do that to protect our servers against various kinds of abuse and please note that we decide what constitutes abuse of our systems.
</p>

<h3>Registered user</h3>
<p>
    If you're willing to register your email address with us, we'll increase your API rate limit. We get the benefit of knowing a little bit more about you and in return we raise the limit so that you can use the service more. The API key is portable which means that once you have registered, you can use the same API key on multiple WordPress installations.
</p><p>
    We are storing your email address and intend to use it for a few different reasons, the primary reason is that we want to be able to reach out to you. We take your privacy very seriously and we will <strong>never</strong> share your email address with any 3rd party organizations without your consent.
</p><p>
    For the most part, we will reach out to you with technical information about new features, tips and tricks or to share success stories from other users. We might also send you commercial offers about upgrading to on of our paid subscriptions or to inform you about offers from partners within the WordPress space. Our promise to you is that we will only ever send out information that we honestly believe you will benefit from and that it related to WordPress technical stuff like security, management, deployments etc.
</p><p>
    For registered users, we also reserve the right to block an API key, an IP number or even an entire API range at any time. As with anonymous users, we'd only do that to protect our servers against various kinds of abuse and please note that we decide what constitutes abuse of our systems.
</p>

<h3>Paid users</h3>
<p>
    We offer various paid subscriptions that significantly raises the hourly rate limit of our API. Paid subscriptions. These are aimed at various kinds of power users such as hosting providers, WordPress agencies and professional developers. The terms of API usage for these commercial offerings are defined for each different package. Please visit <a href="https://www.wpessentials.io/plugins/integrity-checker/" target="_blank">https://www.wpessentials.io/plugins/integrity-checker/</a> for more information.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the data you receive as a paid user is no different that the data you get as an free user. The primary purpose of upgrading to a paid subscription is to be able to run larger and more regular scans of multiple WordPress installations.
